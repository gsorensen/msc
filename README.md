# TTK4900 – Engineering Cybernetics, Master's Thesis

This repository contains software components from my master's thesis project which utilise – without modifications to the original source – helper functions from the MSS toolbox from Fossen and Perez (2004) (Repository: https://github.com/cybergalactic/MSS). 

The MSS toolbox is released under the GNU General Public License v3 which states that software which utilises the toolbox must have its source code made available publicly and released under the same license. This repository serves as fullfilment of the license terms and is provided as-is. 

The models and filter that are implemented are derived in the master's thesis itself.
